    "- All features are standardize by number of possessions in the game. However the number of possessions is usually not directly computed live, so it is estimated. As a possession end either when a shot is taken, a rebound is taken, or if there is a turnover, it is usually estimated using those stats. The way they are weighted varies. This article does a nice recap: https://fansided.com/2015/12/21/nylon-calculus-101-possessions/. Here are two formulas used:\n",
    "    - In the paper -> $Possessions=0.96*(FGA−OR−TO+(0.475∗FTA))$\n",
    "    - On NBA.com -> $Possessions=(FGA+0.44*FTA–ORB+TOV)/2$    \n",
    "This however raises the question on if the computation should be different for FIBA basketball.\n",
    "- \"Four Factors\" are four stats that are said to be the most relevant in a team success in the litterature. They are: *Effective field goal percentage*, *Turnover percentage*, *Offensive Rebound Percentage* and *Free throw rate*. They should be considered as based features probably.\n",
    "- Usage of offensive and defensive ratings, but adjusted with the opponents ratings, as putting good offensive number should be more relevant aginst a good defensive rather than a poor defensive team. Adjusted offensive and defensive ratings should also be taken into account more.\n",
    "- A model to estmate win ratio: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation#Use_in_basketball\n",
    "- They estimated which were the most relevant features to make a prediction (measure accuracy among all models): \"We found the combi-nations of location and adjusted offensive and defensive efficiencies, and locationand Four Factors to work best\""

ALthough it is not of direct interest for this project, it first, shows the importance of the coach, which may be interesting to quantify somehow in our features, and secondly, talks about a statistic to quantify player's quality: the **Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)**. This page ([https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html)) gives a more in-depth look at how it is computed and how it can be used.\n",

    "Although the NBA formula is pretty clear ($(FGA + 0.44*FTA – ORB + TOV)$), it acocunts for all ways a possessions ends (FGA, TOV, FTA) minus when it is not ending (ORB). The mutiplier is here to balance the fact that free-throws are either shot alone (\"and one\"), by pairs (most of the cases), or by three. Thus 44% of the FA end the possession on average. It is unclear if this also applies to FIBA basketball."
