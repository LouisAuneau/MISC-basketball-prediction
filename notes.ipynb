    "- All features are standardize by number of possessions in the game. However the number of possessions is usually not directly computed live, so it is estimated. As a possession end either when a shot is taken, a rebound is taken, or if there is a turnover, it is usually estimated using those stats. The way they are weighted varies. This article does a nice recap: https://fansided.com/2015/12/21/nylon-calculus-101-possessions/. Here are two formulas used:\n",
    "    - In the paper -> $Possessions=0.96*(FGA−OR−TO+(0.475∗FTA))$\n",
    "    - On NBA.com -> $Possessions=(FGA+0.44*FTA–ORB+TOV)/2$    \n",
    "This however raises the question on if the computation should be different for FIBA basketball.\n",
    "- \"Four Factors\" are four stats that are said to be the most relevant in a team success in the litterature. They are: *Effective field goal percentage*, *Turnover percentage*, *Offensive Rebound Percentage* and *Free throw rate*. They should be considered as based features probably.\n",
    "- Usage of offensive and defensive ratings, but adjusted with the opponents ratings, as putting good offensive number should be more relevant aginst a good defensive rather than a poor defensive team. Adjusted offensive and defensive ratings should also be taken into account more.\n",
    "- A model to estmate win ratio: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation#Use_in_basketball\n",
    "- They estimated which were the most relevant features to make a prediction (measure accuracy among all models): \"We found the combi-nations of location and adjusted offensive and defensive efficiencies, and locationand Four Factors to work best\""

If all FTAs are from 2 point shooting foul possessions, the coefficient should be 0.5, 0.333 for all 3 point shooting foul possessions, and 0 for all and-1 possessions.
